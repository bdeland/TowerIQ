# TowerIQ Part 2 Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented all core application logic and backend services as specified in Part 2 of the development task list. This includes the central MainController with PyQt signals, the SetupService for environment orchestration, and the EmulatorService and FridaService for device interaction and secure injection.

## ✅ Implemented Components

### 1. MainController (Updated)
**File:** `src/tower_iq/main_controller.py`

**Key Features:**
- ✅ Inherits from `QObject` for PyQt signals support
- ✅ PyQt Signals for UI communication:
  - `log_received = pyqtSignal(dict)` - For UI log viewer
  - `status_changed = pyqtSignal(str, str)` - For status updates
  - `new_metric_received = pyqtSignal(str, object)` - For dashboard metrics
  - `setup_finished = pyqtSignal(bool)` - For setup completion
- ✅ **Dispatch Pattern** implementation with message handlers:
  - `_handle_game_metric()` - Processes metric data
  - `_handle_game_event()` - Processes game events
  - `_handle_hook_log()` - Processes Frida script logs
- ✅ Async lifecycle management with `run()` and `stop()` methods
- ✅ System health monitoring with periodic checks
- ✅ Integration with all new services

### 2. SetupService (New)
**File:** `src/tower_iq/services/setup_service.py`

**Key Features:**
- ✅ Complete WSL installation and management
- ✅ Docker installation within WSL distribution
- ✅ Environment validation without installation attempts
- ✅ Setup completion tracking with marker files
- ✅ Error handling with `SetupStepFailedError` exception
- ✅ Integration with UI through signal emitter

**Methods Implemented:**
- `run_initial_setup()` - Main setup orchestration
- `validate_environment()` - Health checks
- `_check_and_install_wsl()` - WSL installation with elevation
- `_import_wsl_distro()` - Custom distribution import
- `_install_docker_in_wsl()` - Docker setup in WSL
- `_mark_setup_as_complete()` - Completion tracking

### 3. EmulatorService (New)
**File:** `src/tower_iq/services/emulator_service.py`

**Key Features:**
- ✅ ADB device discovery and connection
- ✅ Device architecture detection
- ✅ Frida-server installation and management
- ✅ Process ID discovery for target applications
- ✅ Connection health monitoring

**Methods Implemented:**
- `find_and_connect_device()` - Device discovery and connection
- `get_device_architecture()` - CPU architecture detection
- `install_frida_server()` - Binary installation on device
- `start_frida_server()` - Process management
- `is_frida_server_running()` - Status checking
- `get_game_pid()` - Target process discovery

### 4. FridaService (New)
**File:** `src/tower_iq/services/frida_service.py`

**Key Features:**
- ✅ Secure script download and verification workflow
- ✅ Process attachment and detachment
- ✅ Message queue for async communication
- ✅ Security validation with signature verification
- ✅ Script decryption and hash validation

**Methods Implemented:**
- `attach()` - Process attachment
- `detach()` - Clean disconnection
- `inject_script()` - Secure script injection
- `get_message()` - Async message retrieval
- `_download_and_verify_script()` - Security workflow
- `_on_message()` - Frida callback bridge

## 🔧 Technical Architecture

### Message Dispatch Pattern
The MainController implements a clean dispatch pattern that maps message types to handler methods:

```python
self._message_handlers = {
    "game_metric": self._handle_game_metric,
    "game_event": self._handle_game_event,
    "hook_log": self._handle_hook_log,
}
```

### Async Communication Flow
1. **FridaService** receives messages from injected scripts
2. Messages are queued in `asyncio.Queue` for thread-safe handling
3. **MainController** continuously listens via `_listen_for_frida_messages()`
4. Messages are dispatched to appropriate handlers
5. Handlers process data and emit PyQt signals for UI updates

### Service Integration
All services are dependency-injected into the MainController:
- **SetupService** - Orchestrates environment setup
- **EmulatorService** - Manages device connections
- **FridaService** - Handles secure injection
- **DatabaseService** - Stores metrics and events
- **DockerService** - Manages backend infrastructure

## 🧪 Testing Results

Successfully tested with a comprehensive test script that verified:
- ✅ All services initialize correctly
- ✅ Message handlers are registered properly
- ✅ PyQt signals are defined correctly
- ✅ EmulatorService detects connected devices
- ✅ Message dispatch pattern works correctly
- ✅ Error handling functions as expected

## 🔄 Integration with Existing Code

The implementation seamlessly integrates with existing components:
- **ConfigurationManager** - Used by all services for settings
- **SessionManager** - Updated by game event handlers
- **DatabaseService** - Called by metric and event handlers
- **DockerService** - Managed by SetupService

## 🚀 Next Steps

Part 2 implementation is complete and ready for Part 3 (GUI components). The MainController now provides:
- PyQt signal-based communication for UI integration
- Complete backend service orchestration
- Secure Frida injection capabilities
- Robust error handling and monitoring

All services are tested and functional, providing a solid foundation for the GUI layer implementation in Part 3.
