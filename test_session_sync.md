# ConnectionPage Session State Sync Fix

## Problem
The ConnectionPage UI did not stay in sync with the backend session state. When a user connected to a device and then navigated away from the page and back, the UI would reset to the initial state (showing "Start" button) even though the backend was still connected and monitoring was active.

## Root Causes

1. **Interface Mismatch**: The frontend `SessionState` interface expected `connection_stage` and `connection_message` fields, but the backend provided `connection_state`, `connection_sub_state`, and `last_error` fields.

2. **Incomplete State Sync**: The ConnectionPage component didn't properly handle initial state synchronization when the component mounted with an already-connected backend.

3. **Missing Navigation Handling**: The sync logic didn't account for users navigating away and back to the page.

## Solution

### 1. Fixed Interface Mismatch
Updated `src/gui/TowerIQ/src/hooks/useBackend.ts`:
```typescript
export interface SessionState {
  is_connected: boolean;
  current_device?: string;
  current_process?: any;
  test_mode: boolean;
  connection_state?: string;        // Changed from connection_stage
  connection_sub_state?: string;    // Added
  device_monitoring_active?: boolean; // Added
  last_error?: any;                 // Added
}
```

### 2. Enhanced State Synchronization
Updated `src/gui/TowerIQ/src/pages/ConnectionPage.tsx`:

- **Initial Sync**: Added a useEffect that runs when status becomes available to sync the UI with backend state on page load
- **Improved State Mapping**: Better handling of different backend connection states (`active`, `connected`, `connecting`, `disconnected`)
- **Device Sync**: Enhanced device selection sync to handle both connection and disconnection cases
- **Debug Logging**: Added comprehensive logging for troubleshooting state sync issues

### 3. State Machine Logic
The fix implements proper state machine logic:
- `active` → `MONITORING_ACTIVE` (Show Stop button)
- `connected` → `IDLE` (Show Start button, device connected)
- `connecting` → `CONNECTING_DEVICE` (Show progress)
- `disconnected` → `IDLE` (Show Start button, no device)

## Testing Steps

1. **Connect to Device**: 
   - Go to ConnectionPage
   - Select device and click Start
   - Verify button changes to "Stop"

2. **Navigate Away and Back**:
   - Navigate to another page (e.g., Dashboard)
   - Navigate back to ConnectionPage
   - Verify UI still shows "Stop" button and connected state

3. **Disconnect and Navigate**:
   - Click Stop to disconnect
   - Navigate away and back
   - Verify UI shows "Start" button and disconnected state

## Files Modified

1. `src/gui/TowerIQ/src/hooks/useBackend.ts` - Fixed SessionState interface
2. `src/gui/TowerIQ/src/pages/ConnectionPage.tsx` - Enhanced state synchronization logic

## Expected Behavior After Fix

- ✅ UI stays in sync when navigating between pages
- ✅ Connected state persists across navigation
- ✅ Proper button states (Start/Stop) based on backend state
- ✅ Device selection syncs with backend connected device
- ✅ Status messages reflect actual backend state
