- Created dependency injection system in `dependencies.py`
- Moved device caching utilities to `cache_utils.py`

### Phase 2: Simple Routers ✅
- Extracted `health.py` router (7 endpoints)
- Extracted `adb.py` router (4 endpoints)
- Extracted `scripts.py` router (4 endpoints)
- Extracted `devices.py` router (4 endpoints)

### Phase 3: Medium Routers ✅

### Phase 4: Complex Routers ✅
- Extracted `queries.py` router (3 endpoints)
- Extracted `database.py` router (9 endpoints)
- Extracted `dashboards_v1.py` router (8 endpoints)
- Extracted `dashboards_v2.py` router (5 endpoints)
- Extracted `data_sources.py` router (2 endpoints)

### Phase 5: Integration ✅
- Updated `api_server.py` with router imports
- Initialized all routers in the lifespan function
- Registered all 11 routers with the FastAPI app
- Removed all old endpoint definitions (1,875 lines)
- Verified no linting errors

## 🔧 How to Use

### Starting the Server

Use the provided start script (recommended):
```bash
python scripts/start_backend.py
```

Or directly:
```bash
python backend/api_server.py
```

### Testing Endpoints

All 58 endpoints are now organized and accessible at their original paths:

- **Health**: `GET /`, `GET /api/status`
- **Devices**: `GET /api/devices`, `POST /api/devices/refresh`
- **Connection**: `POST /api/connect`, `POST /api/disconnect`
- **Dashboards**: `GET /api/dashboards`, `GET /api/v2/dashboards`
- **And 49 more...**

### API Documentation

Visit `http://localhost:8000/docs` for interactive API documentation (FastAPI's built-in Swagger UI).

## 📝 Code Quality Verification

### Linting Results

```bash
# Run linting on the refactored code
python scripts/lint.py

# Result: ✅ No errors in api_server.py or routers
```

### File Size Check

```bash
# api_server.py reduced from 2,393 to 289 lines
# Average router size: ~208 lines
# All files under 350 lines ✅
```

---

## 🎓 Pattern Established

Every router follows this consistent pattern:

```python
"""
[Router Name] Router

Handles:
- [Responsibility 1]
- [Responsibility 2]
"""

from fastapi import APIRouter, HTTPException
from typing import [types]

from ..models import [models]
from ..dependencies import [dependencies]

router = APIRouter()

# Module-level dependencies
logger = None
service = None

def initialize(log, svc):
    """Initialize module-level dependencies."""
    global logger, service
    logger = log
    service = svc

@router.get("/api/endpoint")
async def endpoint_handler():
    """Handle endpoint request."""
    # Implementation
    pass
```
