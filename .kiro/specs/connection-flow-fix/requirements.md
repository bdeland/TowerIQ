# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The TowerIQ application has critical issues with its connection flow and state management that prevent proper reconnection after disconnecting from a device. The current implementation has several problems:

1. **Hook Reactivation Failure**: After disconnecting from a device, users cannot reactivate the hook - the connection process fails silently or gets stuck
2. **Missing Connection Progress**: The connection progress page doesn't appear when activating hooks, leaving users without feedback during the connection process
3. **Inconsistent State Management**: The application state becomes inconsistent between the session manager, UI components, and services after disconnection
4. **Navigation Flow Issues**: The UI navigation between connection stages is unreliable and doesn't properly reflect the actual connection state

These issues severely impact the user experience and make the application unreliable for repeated use sessions.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Reliable Hook Reactivation

**User Story:** As a user, I want to be able to disconnect from a device and then reconnect/reactivate the hook multiple times during a session, so that I can switch between devices or restart connections without restarting the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user disconnects from an active hook connection THEN the system SHALL properly clean up all connection state and resources
2. WHEN a user attempts to reactivate a hook after disconnection THEN the system SHALL successfully establish a new connection using the same process as the initial connection
3. WHEN the hook reactivation process completes THEN the system SHALL be in the same functional state as after the initial connection
4. IF the hook reactivation fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and allow retry attempts
5. WHEN multiple disconnect/reconnect cycles occur THEN each cycle SHALL work reliably without degradation

### Requirement 2: Consistent Connection Progress Display

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see detailed progress feedback during hook activation, so that I understand what the system is doing and can identify where issues occur if the connection fails.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user initiates hook activation THEN the system SHALL immediately display the connection progress page
2. WHEN the connection process progresses through stages THEN the UI SHALL update in real-time to show the current stage and status
3. WHEN a connection stage completes successfully THEN the UI SHALL visually indicate completion with appropriate feedback
4. WHEN a connection stage fails THEN the UI SHALL clearly show the failure with specific error information
5. WHEN the entire connection process completes THEN the UI SHALL transition to the appropriate final state (active or failed)

### Requirement 3: Robust State Management

**User Story:** As a developer/user, I want the application state to remain consistent across all components during connection lifecycle events, so that the UI accurately reflects the actual system state and all components work correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any connection state changes occur THEN all relevant components (session manager, UI, services) SHALL be updated consistently
2. WHEN a disconnection occurs THEN the system SHALL reset all connection-related state to initial values
3. WHEN state transitions happen THEN the system SHALL validate state consistency and log any inconsistencies
4. IF state inconsistencies are detected THEN the system SHALL attempt automatic correction or provide clear error messages
5. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL initialize all components to a consistent default state

### Requirement 4: Proper Resource Cleanup

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to properly clean up all resources when disconnecting, so that subsequent connections work reliably and system resources are not leaked.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a disconnection occurs THEN the system SHALL properly detach from Frida sessions with timeout handling
2. WHEN Frida resources are cleaned up THEN the system SHALL reset shutdown flags and prepare for new connections
3. WHEN message queues exist THEN the system SHALL properly drain and reset them during cleanup
4. WHEN cleanup operations timeout THEN the system SHALL force cleanup and log appropriate warnings
5. WHEN cleanup completes THEN the system SHALL be ready for immediate reconnection attempts

### Requirement 5: Enhanced Error Handling and Recovery

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear error messages and recovery options when connection issues occur, so that I can understand what went wrong and take appropriate action to resolve the problem.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN connection errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide user-friendly error messages with specific details
2. WHEN recoverable errors happen THEN the system SHALL offer retry options with appropriate guidance
3. WHEN critical errors occur THEN the system SHALL gracefully degrade and allow users to return to a stable state
4. WHEN error recovery is attempted THEN the system SHALL properly reset relevant state before retrying
5. WHEN multiple errors occur THEN the system SHALL prevent error cascading and maintain stability

### Requirement 6: Improved Navigation Flow

**User Story:** As a user, I want intuitive navigation between connection stages that accurately reflects the current state, so that I can easily understand where I am in the process and navigate back to previous stages when needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users navigate between connection stages THEN the breadcrumb navigation SHALL accurately reflect the current stage
2. WHEN users click breadcrumb items THEN the system SHALL properly transition to the requested stage with appropriate state management
3. WHEN automatic stage transitions occur THEN the navigation SHALL update to reflect the new stage
4. WHEN users go back to previous stages THEN the system SHALL properly clean up resources from later stages
5. WHEN stage transitions fail THEN the navigation SHALL remain consistent with the actual system state
