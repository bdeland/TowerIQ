- [ ] 8. Add retry and error recovery functionality
  - Implement retry buttons for failed connection stages
  - Add stage-specific retry logic with exponential backoff for network operations
  - Create user-friendly error messages with suggested actions
  - Add option to restart from device selection or cancel entire process
  - Write tests for retry functionality and error recovery flows
  - _Requirements: 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.4, 6.5_

- [ ] 9. Integrate enhanced services with existing connection flow
  - Update MainController to use enhanced device and process services
