# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the TowerIQ connection flow to provide better device information, improved process filtering, clearer app identification, and a more transparent multi-stage connection process. The enhancement addresses current issues with confusing status terminology, incomplete device information, system process noise, missing app metadata, and unclear background operations during Frida setup.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a TowerIQ user, I want to see comprehensive device information in the device table, so that I can easily identify and select the correct Android device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the device table is populated THEN the system SHALL display device serial, model name, Android version, and connection status
2. WHEN displaying connection status THEN the system SHALL use "Online" instead of "Connected" to avoid confusion with the Connect button
3. WHEN device information is unavailable THEN the system SHALL display "Unknown" or appropriate placeholder text
4. WHEN the device table is refreshed THEN all available device metadata SHALL be retrieved and displayed

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a TowerIQ user, I want to see only relevant third-party applications with proper app names and icons, so that I can quickly identify the target application without system noise.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the process table is populated THEN the system SHALL display only third-party applications that are currently running
2. WHEN displaying app information THEN the system SHALL show the actual app display name from the package manager, not the package name
3. WHEN available THEN the system SHALL display app icons alongside app names
4. WHEN filtering processes THEN the system SHALL exclude system applications like com.google.android.safetycore
5. WHEN an app is not running THEN the system SHALL NOT display it in the process list

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a TowerIQ user, I want to understand what's happening during the connection process, so that I can track progress and troubleshoot issues when they occur.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the connection process starts THEN the system SHALL display a detailed progress view with multiple stages
2. WHEN each stage begins THEN the system SHALL show the current stage name and description
3. WHEN a stage completes successfully THEN the system SHALL mark it as complete and move to the next stage
4. WHEN a stage fails THEN the system SHALL display the error and allow retry or cancellation
5. WHEN background operations are running THEN the system SHALL show real-time status updates

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a TowerIQ user, I want the Frida setup process to be transparent and reliable, so that I understand what's happening and can resolve issues independently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Frida server setup begins THEN the system SHALL show "Checking Frida Server Installation" stage
2. WHEN pushing Frida server THEN the system SHALL show "Installing Frida Server" with progress indication
3. WHEN starting Frida server THEN the system SHALL show "Starting Frida Server" stage
4. WHEN verifying Frida server THEN the system SHALL show "Verifying Frida Server Connection" stage
5. WHEN checking hook compatibility THEN the system SHALL show "Validating Hook Script Compatibility" stage
6. WHEN attaching to process THEN the system SHALL show "Attaching to Target Process" stage
7. IF any stage fails THEN the system SHALL display specific error messages and suggested actions

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a TowerIQ user, I want clear visual feedback during each connection stage, so that I can understand the current status and estimated completion time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a stage is pending THEN the system SHALL display a waiting indicator
2. WHEN a stage is active THEN the system SHALL display a progress spinner and stage description
3. WHEN a stage completes THEN the system SHALL display a success checkmark
4. WHEN a stage fails THEN the system SHALL display an error icon and error message
5. WHEN stages have sub-operations THEN the system SHALL show detailed progress for long-running operations
6. WHEN the entire process completes THEN the system SHALL transition to the active connection view

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a TowerIQ user, I want to retry failed connection steps without restarting the entire process, so that I can resolve temporary issues efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a connection stage fails THEN the system SHALL provide a "Retry" button for that specific stage
2. WHEN retrying a stage THEN the system SHALL reset only that stage and continue from there
3. WHEN multiple retries fail THEN the system SHALL provide options to restart from device selection or cancel
4. WHEN network issues occur THEN the system SHALL automatically retry with exponential backoff
5. WHEN user cancels during any stage THEN the system SHALL clean up resources and return to device selection
